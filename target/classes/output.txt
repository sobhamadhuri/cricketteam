Here, we observed how to handle http handle requests by using JDBC, H2 Database in Spring boot

*we created REST API'S using spring boot, JDBC, H2 Database and SQL
Tested RESTful API'S functionality using postman tool

*GET, GET SPECIFIC TODO, POST, PUT AND DELETE methods are used those all are handled by controller class,
repostiory we have to declare the methods for consistency and abstraction,
In servic class we have written a business logic and
model class we add the actual data representations.
